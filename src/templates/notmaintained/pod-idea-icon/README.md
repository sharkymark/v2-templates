# Launch an IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate IDE from a dashboard icon

### Changes 2024-08-05

1. Notice use of `data.coder_workspace_owner.me`, a new 2024 Coder change in their Terraform provider that replaced `data.coder_workspace.me.owner`
1. Changed container image to build with IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate `2024.1.4`

IntelliJ is launched from a locally-installed JetBrains Gateway client connected to a Coder Cloud Development Environment operating as Kubernetes-managed container with a mounted persistent disk to store personal settings and cloned code repositories. 

### Cloud Cost Control Use Case
1. The templates [establish costs](https://coder.com/docs/v2/latest/admin/quotas#establishing-costs) for compute resources of a workspace. e.g., Kubernetes pod = `20` points and a persistent disk = `10` points. 
2. A group [establishes a budget](https://coder.com/docs/v2/latest/admin/quotas#establishing-budgets) to restrict how many compute resources a developer can use. e.g., `60` points which would allow 2 running workspaces. If the user attempts to create a 3rd, the build will fail and the user notified.
3. This is an Enterprise feature that requires a paid license [Contact Sales](https://coder.com/contact) for more information.

### User inputs

1. The size of the persistent disk `/home/coder` - default 30GB. Range 10-100GB. The disk size cannot be reduced.

### Apps included
1. A web-based terminal
1. JetBrains IDE launched from a dashboard icon (accessible with SSH and JetBrains Gateway)

### IntelliJ IDEA version

### Launching JetBrains Gateway and IntelliJ from a workspace dashboard icon

You must define `coder_app` resource using `external = true` and specific `url` string and format that includes JetBrains-specific information such as`ide_product_code`, `ide_build_number` and `ide_download_link`

The build number tells Gateway which JetBrains client to download to the developer's local machine.

The IDE download link tells Gateway which IDE to download into the Coder workspace.

```hcl
resource "coder_app" "gateway" {
  agent_id     = coder_agent.coder.id
  display_name = "IntelliJ Ultimate"
  slug         = "gateway"
  url          = "jetbrains-gateway://connect#type=coder&workspace=${data.coder_workspace.me.name}&agent=coder&folder=/home/coder/&url=${data.coder_workspace.me.access_url}&token=${data.coder_workspace.me.owner_session_token}&ide_product_code=${local.ide_product_code}&ide_build_number=${local.ide_build_number}&ide_download_link=${local.ide_download_link}"
  icon         = "/icon/intellij.svg"
  external     = true
}
```


### JetBrains IDE images to choose from

Last updated at: 2023-12-30

Switched from Coder deprecated image to custom image

[IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)

[marktmilligan/java:jdk-11 Dockerfile](https://github.com/sharkymark/dockerfiles/blob/main/java/Dockerfile)

[marktmilligan/java container image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/marktmilligan/java/tags)

### Additional bash scripting
1. Prompt user and clone/install a dotfiles repository (for personalization settings)
1. Configure pod spec to use the Docker image specific to the IDE

### Post Build Requisites
1. Install and configure [JetBrains Gateway](https://coder.com/docs/v2/latest/ides/gateway)

### Authentication

This template will use ~/.kube/config to authenticate to a Kubernetes cluster on GCP

Be sure to enter a valid workspaces_namespace at workspace creation to point to the Kubernetes namespace the workspace will be deployed to
