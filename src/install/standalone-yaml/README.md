# Yaml to standardize a standalone Coder deployment

> This feature is experimental. I only use it for simplication and could instead pass parameters to `coder server` directly. I don't use it for production deployments.

## Start the Coder control plane

Running Coder with `coder server` is quick and easy. However it can get unwieldy if you are specifying environment variables.

Start Coder with this Yaml file:

```sh
coder server --config coder.yaml
```

## Export your deployment's configuration as STDOUT Yaml

```sh
coder server --write-config=true
```

## Read through the plethora of configuration settings for a Coder deployment

```sh
coder server --help
```

Search for a specific command or topic

```sh
coder server --help | grep DERP
```
