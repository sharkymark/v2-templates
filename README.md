# Coder OSS help

## Changelog

See the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) file for the latest updates and changes to this project.

## Summary

> I am [no longer with Coder](https://markmilligan.io/experience) so only maintain a handful of Docker-based templates for my own development needs. All the best with your Coder journey!

If you're looking for an v2 trial key, fill out this [form](https://coder.com/trial) for a 30-day trial or you can sign up when creating your admin user after deploying Coder.

Here is an additional repo [coder-hw](https://github.com/sharkymark/coder-hw) with a Python-based CLI using the Coder API.

The [official v2 docs](https://github.com/coder/coder/tree/main/docs) and [template examples](https://github.com/coder/coder/tree/main/examples/templates) are great resources too. Also my colleague [bpmct](https://github.com/bpmct/coder-templates) authors some amazing templates too.

## Coder-maintained templates and modules

I recommend using Coder-maintained templates and modules in the [Coder Registry](https://registry.coder.com/).

## Deprecated templates

Within the `src\templates` directory, you'll find the handful of Docker-based templates that I use personally. Any other templates in the `notmaintained` directory are no longer maintained but you'll welcome to use them as a reference.

## API examples

You can find API endpoints from inspecting the UI in your browser tools. [Here are examples](api.md) to get you going. This new repo [coder-hw](https://github.com/sharkymark/coder-hw) heavily uses the Coder API with a Python-based CLI app.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

[Coder's docs](https://github.com/coder/coder/tree/main/docs) are the first place to answers.

## Easiest way to getting started

The easiest and fastest way to run Coder is from the command line with the `coder` binary.

Download it here

```sh
curl -fsSL https://coder.com/install.sh | sh
```

To specify a version and dry run before actually installing

```sh
 curl -L https://coder.com/install.sh | sh -s -- --dry-run --version 2.10.0
```

Using fsS along with L, causes `curl` to fail silently on server errors, preventing showing the progress meter, and still show an error if it fails.

If you're on macOS and not a fan of `brew` like me, make sure you run this command instead:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://coder.com/install.sh | sh -s -- --method standalone
```

> BTW, the coder binary is also the Coder CLI, which you use to create, push templates, even create, start, stop workspaces, API Key tokens, etc.

You can pass parameters/flags after `coder server` but I have a nice [`coder.yaml`](./standalone-yaml/coder.yaml) to easily tweak settings.

```sh
coder server --config coder.yaml
```

## Templates

The example templates that ship with v2 are [here](https://github.com/coder/coder/tree/main/examples/templates) and [bpmct](https://github.com/bpmct/coder-templates) has some sweet templates too like podman and nifty AWS VM template that only persists the home volume.
